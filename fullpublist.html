<div style='margin-left:1em;padding-bottom:4px;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:800px;'>
In this paper we describe meta-data aware model training for more robust wake word detection. 
Wake word detection is important element of modern voice-enabled intelligent assistants 
like Alexa or Hey Google required for accurate start of streaming of customer audio to the Cloud for processing 
while minimizing privacy incursion. In this 
Because wake word models operate continuously on devices and are exposed to wide variety of audio inputs from different
acoustic and background conditions, they commonly affected by OP-condition mismatch problem, where the DNN model's performance
may vary widely for different acoustic conditions, leading to requirements of setting different OPs for different such conditions
and overall reducing accuracy.
In this case, we focus on Alexa detection with and without on-device playback. 
We show that by incorporating the knowledge of the presence of playback on-device into model training in the form
of conditional batch normalization, based on the playback-state metadata reported by devices, 
it is possible to improve accuracy of wake word spotting model.

<div style='margin-left:1em;padding-bottom:4px;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:800px;'>
In this paper we present fully neural solution for on-device wake word spotting using a single CNN with long "word-level" input context, 
including the accurate detection of the start and end points of the wakeword in such "word-level" input. 
Accurate wake word start and end detection is important requirement to on-device wake word spotters for intelligent assistants 
like Alexa or Hey Google required for accurate start of streaming of customer audio to the Cloud for processing, maximizing
streaming requests' accuracy while minimizing privacy incursion. In this paper we develop a novel fully neural solution
for such wake word start and end point detection in single-stage CNN "word-level" wake word detectors that provides
accuracy on par with gold-standard Acoustic Model+HMM ASR forced alignment while being significantly simpler and cheaper
to train and deploy on devices.

<div style='margin-left:1em;padding-bottom:4px;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:800px;'>In this paper we present data-efficient solutions to
address the challenges in WW modeling, such as domain-mismatch,
noisy conditions, limited annotation, etc. The proposed system is
composed of a multi-condition training pipeline with a stratified data
augmentation, which improves the model robustness to a variety
of predefined acoustic conditions, together with a semi-supervised
learning pipeline to accurately extract the WW and confusable examples from untranscribed speech corpus. Starting from only 10 hours
of domain-mismatched WW audio, we are able to enlarge and enrich
the training dataset by 20-100 times to capture the acoustic complexity. Our experiments on real user data show that the proposed so-
lutions can achieve comparable performance of a production-grade
model by saving 97% of the amount of WW-specific data collection
and 86% of the bandwidth for annotation.

<div style='margin-left:1em;padding-bottom:4px;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:800px;'>In this paper, we investigate novel quantization
approaches to reduce memory and computational footprint of
deep neural network (DNN) based keyword spotters (KWS). We
propose a new method for KWS offline and online quantization,
which we call dynamic quantization, where we quantize DNN
weight matrices column-wise, using each column's exact individual min-max range, and the DNN layers' inputs and outputs
are quantized for every input audio frame individually, using the
exact min-max range of each input and output vector. We further
apply a new quantization-aware training approach that allows
us to incorporate quantization errors into KWS model during
training. Together, these approaches allow us to significantly
improve the performance of KWS in 4-bit and 8-bit quantized
precision, achieving the end-to-end accuracy close to that of full
precision models while reducing the models' on-device memory
footprint by up to 80%.' Full text is <a href='icmla-2019-reprint.pdf'>here</a>.

<div style='margin-left:1em;padding-bottom:4px;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:800px;'>Recent advances in technology bring about novel operating environments where the role of human participants is reduced to passive observation. While opening new frontiers in productivity and lifestyle, such environments also create hazards related to the inability of human individuals to maintain focus and concentration during passive control tasks. A passive brain-computer interface for monitoring mental attention states of human individuals (focused, unfocused, and drowsy) by using electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity imaging and machine learning data analysis methods is developed in this work. An EEG data processing pipeline and a machine learning mental state detection algorithm using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method were designed and compared with k-Nearest Neighbor and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy System methods. To collect 25 h of EEG data from 5 participants, a classic EEG headset was modified. We found that the changes in EEG activity in frontal and parietal lobes occurring...

The EEG BCI system is shown to correctly identify different motor imageries in EEG data with good accuracy. 3 participants are shown to achieve BCI control accuracy in offline experiments of 80-90%. 2 participants did not achieve satisfactory accuracy. Online BCI system is then implemented for control of a virtual 3 degree-of-freedom prosthetic arm and tested with 3 best participants.

<div style='margin-left:1em;padding-bottom:4px;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:800px;'>Operators who use a vehicle have less control load with fast improvements of robotic and autonom systems so that situation causes losing of attention an operator while important control processes. In this paper, a passive brain computer interface for monitoring mental attention state of human individuals by using electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity imaging is developed using a machine learning data analysis method Support Vector Machine. Also a mental state detection system using EEG data is evolved as well. It has been determined that changes in EEG activity in the frontal and parietal lobes occurring in the 1-5 Hz and 1015 Hz frequency bands are associated with changes in attention state. Such changes were detected with 90% to 95% accuracy in experimental settings. The results of the work done will guide the design of future systems to monitor the status of the operators via EEG brain activity data.

<div style='margin-left:1em;padding-bottom:4px;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:800px;'>Monte Carlo approaches have recently been proposed to quantify and estimate connectivity in neuronal networks.  The key problem is to sample from the conditional distribution of a single neuronal spike train, given the activity of the other neurons in the network.  Dependencies between neurons are usually relatively weak; however, temporal dependencies within the spike train of a single neuron are typically strong. In this paper we develop several Metropolis-Hastings samplers which are specialized to take advantage of this dependency structure.  These samplers are based on two ideas:  1) an adaptation of fast forward-backward algorithms from the theory of hidden Markov models to take advantage of the local dependencies inherent in spike trains, and 2) a first-order expansion of the conditional likelihood which allows for efficient exact sampling in the limit of weak coupling between neurons. We also demonstrate that these samplers can effectively incorporate side information, in particular... Full text is <a href='eff-sampling-reprint.pdf'>here</a>.

<div style='margin-left:1em;padding-bottom:4px;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:800px;'>In this paper we develop a statistical method for inferring neural connectivity matrix from neural population spontaneous activity recording with fluorescent calcium imaging, and study how well such performance may be done under various experimental conditions. We find that such inference may be performed remarkably well, allowing quite accurate estimation of the functional connectivity matrix under plausible neuro-biological and imaging conditions from observation containing ~1500-3000 spikes per neuron (~5-10 min observation of neural population spontaneously spiking ~5Hz). One interesting, unexpected conclusion is that this observation time requirement does not grow with the size of neural population. Ie, even for very large neural circuits, ~100-1000 neurons, connectivity matrix can be inferred by monitoring their activity for the same duration. That's definitely a very valuable property of this method.

<div style='margin-left:1em;padding-bottom:4px;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:800px;'>Complete reconstructions of vertebrate neuronal circuits on the synaptic level require new approaches. Here, serial section transmission electron microscopy was automated to densely reconstruct four volumes, totaling 670 ?m^3, from the rat hippocampus as proving grounds to determine when axo-dendritic proximities predict synapses. First, in contrast with Peters' rule, the density of axons within reach of dendritic spines did not predict synaptic density along dendrites because the fraction of axons making synapses was variable. Second, an axo-dendritic touch did not predict a synapse; nevertheless, the density of synapses along a hippocampal dendrite appeared to be a universal fraction, 0.2, of the density of touches. Finally, the largest touch between an axonal bouton and spine indicated the site of actual synapses with about 80% precision but would miss about half of all synapses. Thus, it will be difficult to predict synaptic connectivity using data sets missing ultrastructural details'... Full text is <a href='Mishchenko_Ultrastructural_Reprint.pdf'>here</a>.

I use this fact to suggest an approach to mapping connectivity in a neural circuit by labeling synapses of different groups of cells using distinct color fluorescent synaptic markers, and then scanning neuropil optically searching for synaptic puncta of given color - thus identifying the location and number and size of all synapses between given populations of neurons.

The above two tasks can be seen as part of neural circuits reconstruction problem, using the tools of electron microscopy, which involves identification of synapses, segmentation of axonal and dendritic processes, and tracing them toward cell body in order to establish presence of a connection between two cell in a neural circuit. Such approach is considered to be the main option for large scale, complete, and detailed anatomical reconstructions of neural circuits; although some significant problems with this paradigm had been found and discussed in this paper.

This setup can be treated as random sampling of the connections from the connectivity matrix, which therefore allows to infer the connectivity matrix from a sample of such measurements using the analysis methods of compressive sensing. Analysis of potential performance of such approach in one popular neuroscience model, C. elegans, leads to very encouraging results, implying that complete connectivity in that animal can be routinely reconstructed over a span of a few days - a fit yet unheard of in neuroscience.

<div style='margin-left:1em;padding-bottom:4px;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:800px;'>This works introduces an original "solution" to so called fermion problem of diffusion Monte Carlo. Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo is a method for solving Schrodinger equation using what is now known particle filtering, ie by interpreting solution wave-function as density of diffusing particles, and then simulating diffusion corresponding to particular potential in Schrodinger equation. Fermion sign problem is a very old issue with this paradigm, applied to calculation of the ground states of fermion, since the true ground state of Schrodinger equation is always bosonic, and fermionic ground state is exp-weak fluctuation on top of it. Solution proposed in this paper was to supplement Schrodinger equation with non-local anti-symmetrization operator, which makes fermion state the true ground state of the problem. This solution was moderately successful, whereas non-local nature of the anti-symmetrization operator led to complications extending this idea to higher dimensional problems. Ultimately...

<div style='margin-left:1em;padding-bottom:4px;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:800px;'>This work studies the phenomenon that certain diagrams in perturbative quantum field theory (QFT), nonvanishing when written covariantly, vanish in Light Front reference frame. The problem is linked, in this paper, to two types of limits, not performed carefully typically when going to Light Front reference frame. Outer arc integration limit is one of them, whereas when reducing covariant integrands by integrating out one of the momentum variables using Cauchy residues, the infinite arc closing the contour is often dismissed, even in certain cases it gives contribution to the integral, as we show. The second type of limits is the case where particular cingular points on the integration axis of the remaining integrand give a finite-constant contribution. Properly taking care of these limits restore the equivalence between LF and covariant frames without need for any ad-hoc regularization prescriptions. Full text is <a href='arc-rev.pdf'>here</a>.

<div style='margin-left:1em;padding-bottom:4px;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:800px;'>We study here a novel approach to finding ground state of a quantum field theory. Ground state is the quantum state of a field theory that minimizes its energy, E[H]. Since quantum state is, in general, a functional, such optimization, in general, is very difficult. In some cases, E[H] can be decomposed into a sum of fairly simple expectations. An obvious example - E[H]=E[K]+E[V], where K is kinetic energy term, and V is the potential. The essence of this work is to solve variational problem in terms of this expectation values after finding a set of constraints they should satisfy. I.e., instead of solving variational functional problem, solve min A + B, where A and B are simply numbers, A=E[K], B=E[V], satisfying constraints C(A,B)=0 established by analyzing (E[K],E[V]) for all possible quantum states.
