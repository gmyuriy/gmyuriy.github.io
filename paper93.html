		The paper looks into recent issue of "stochastic variability" in make-up of living cells that are thought to have to be identical (that is same genotype, same environment, same phenotype). It is shown that rather straightforward effect of such cells homeostatically maintaining their internal state would lead very generally to similar phenomenon of "stochastic variability" of the internal make-up of identical organisms.  <a href=021048.full-rev1.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
