		<h1>Yuriy Mishchenko Papers:<br>Ji C.-R., Mishchenko Y. (2002) "The general theory of quantum field mixing.", Physical Review D 65, 096015</h1> 
		In this paper we develop general quantum-field-theoretic formalism for studying quantum flavor mixing of particles, for arbitrary number of flavors and arbitrary spin. Special cases of spin 0 (mesons), spin 1/2 (neutrinos) and spin 1 (vector-mesons) are explicitly considered.   <a href=A2-Mishchenko_2002.PRD.General-theory-of.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
