		<h1>Yuriy Mishchenko Papers:<br>Mishchenko Y. (2016) "Consistent estimation of complete neuronal connectivity in large neuronal populations using sparse 'shotgun' neuronal activity sampling.", Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 41, 158-184</h1> 
		This paper analyses recently proposed "shotgun" neuronal activity imaging solution for impossibility of completely imaging large neuronal circuits in the brain with required accuracy. The paper offers a number of theoretical results establishing correctness of complete neuronal connectivity matrices reconstructions with this type of "sparse" neuronal activity monitoring, as well as establishing necessary conditions that need to be met by imaging protocol designs to insure such correctness. A numerical Expectation Maximization Sequantial Monte-Carlo algorithm is also provided for solving resulting estimation problem in general neuronal activity models.  <a href=Reprint-paged-10.1007_s10827-016-0611-y.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
