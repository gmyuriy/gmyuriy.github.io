		<h1>Yuriy Mishchenko Papers:<br>Mishchenko Y. (2015) "A function for fast computation of large discrete Euclidean distance transforms in three or more dimensions in Matlab.", Signal, Image and Video Processing, 9, 19</h1> 
		This paper describes a fast line scan algorithm for calculations of discrete Euclidean
distance transform in dimensions three or higher, also available from Matlab Central as function "bwdistsc".
Implemented in Matlab as a plain script,
described algorithm outperforms standard compiled
Matlab's Image Processing Toolbox's function
"bwdist" in terms of the calculation time by a factor of two.
Described implementation also allows processing data of much larger size
and calculations of the Euclidean distance transform
with the data having anisotropic pixel dimensions (aspect ratio).  <a href=online-reprint.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
