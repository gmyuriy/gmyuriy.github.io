		An EEG-BCI system for detecting the attention states of process or machinery operators in primarily passive control task. Suggests and SVM+EEG-BCI system for identification of focused, unfocused and sleepy states of passive control task operators and demonstrates validity on certain virtual reality application.  <a href=reprint07129802.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
