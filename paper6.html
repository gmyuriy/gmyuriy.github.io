		This work is a pQCD study in Light Front of the pion generalized parton distribution (GPD) computed in an effective theory with exponential wave-function representation of quarks, which was shown earlier by C.-R. Ji to reproduce pion form-factors rather well. The leading perturbative contribution to pion's GPD correspond to 2-body state of that theory only. This particular work calculates the next-to-leading correction containing 3-body state (ie gluon exchange corrections).  <a href=HigherFockStateContributions2006.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
