		In this work we study translation of high-frequency flavor oscillation effects, found in quantum field theory for flavor mixing and primarily related to virtual anti-particle creation associated with the flavor oscillations, into space-domain. In particular, we predict a small antiparticle anti-beam, traveling in the direction opposing to flavor particles, that should exist in particles oscillating further away from relativistic regime, such as Kaons or eta.   <a href=TimeToSpaceConversion2004.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
