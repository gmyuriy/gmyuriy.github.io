</p>
<p>
<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
The course’s objective is to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of physics and their practical applications, and to provide students with a foundation to build upon in their future studies. The course introduces to non-major students physical quantities and measurements, mechanical motion, force, work and energy, and oscillations and waves.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Course Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>	quantitative measurements, physical quantities, units;
<li>	vectors and operations with with vectors;
<li>	kinematics of mechanical motion and simple mechanical motions;
<li>	dynamics of mechanical motion, Newton’s laws, forces and momentum;
<li>	solving dynamical motion using forces and Newton's laws;
<li>	rotational motion, angular momentum and torque, rolling;
<li>	conservation laws for energy, linear, and angular momentum and their applications;
<li>	oscillatory and wave motion, forced oscillations and resonance, properties of waves, superposition of waves and interference.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Laboratory Works</h3>
The course program includes one laboratory class per week in which students will acquire practical skills in performing and observing physical experiments as well as familiarize themselves with various physical concepts in practice. Attendance of the laboratory is compulsory.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Self study</h3>
Students will be offered one homework assignment per week for self-study and control (not compulsory).
</p>
<p>
<h3>Exams and Quizzes</h3>
The course program includes one midterm and one final exam.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
Students’ final grade is: 15% attendance and class work, 20% laboratory work, 10% quizzes, 15% midterm exam, 40% final exam.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Office Hours</h3>
By appointement
