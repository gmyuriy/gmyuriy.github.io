<h3>Laboratory Works</h3>
The course program includes one laboratory class per week in which students will acquire practical skills in performing and observing physical experiments as well as familiarize themselves with various physical concepts in practice. Attendance of the laboratory is compulsory.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Self study</h3>
The course program includes one homework assignment per week for self-study and self-control. Homework assignments are not compulsory.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Exams and Quizzes</h3>
The course program includes one midterm exams and one final exam. 
Midterm exam is 15% of the grade and the final exam is 40% of the grade.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
Students’ final grade is: 15% attendance and class work, 20% laboratory work, 10% quizzes, 15% midterm, 40% final exam.
