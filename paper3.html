		This paper publishes methods for segmentation and tracing of neural processes in the images acquired with serial section transmission electron microscopy of neural tissue. The above two tasks can be seen as part of neural circuits reconstruction problem, using the tools of electron microscopy, which involves identification of synapses, segmentation of axonal and dendritic processes, and tracing them toward cell body in order to establish presence of a connection between two cell in a neural circuit. Such approach is considered to be the main option for large scale, complete, and detailed anatomical reconstructions of neural circuits; although some significant problems with this paradigm had been found and discussed in this paper.
