		The paper provides a numerical study of various possible conditions of colliding galaxy clusters and searches for signatures that could be left in such collisions by weak self-interactions of dark matter. Certain such signatures are found and related to some recent observations in galaxy cluster collisions' astrophysics.   <a href=blast-1511.00597.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
