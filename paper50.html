		<h1>Yuriy Mishchenko Papers:<br>Rah J.-C., Bas E., Colonell J., Mishchenko Y., et al. (2013) "Thalamocortical input onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons measured using quantitative large-scale array tomography.", Frontiers in Neural Circuits, 7, 177</h1> 
		The paper is the first work to perform a large scale imaging of thalamocortical synapsesusing array-tomography imaging technique and detection of synapses from such optical data using co-localization of fluorescent dies associated to pre- and post-synaptic structures (see further Mishchenko Y. (2010) On Optical Detection of Densely Labeled Synapses in Neuropil and Mapping Connectivity with Combinatorially Multiplexed Fluorescent Synaptic Markers. PLoS ONE 5(1): e8853). The paper verifies and quantifies the accuracy of co-localization optical detection of synapses directly against correlative EM data, and then uses imaging of a large segment of volume of layer 5 cortical tissue to reconstruct a large number of thalamocortical synapses and to relate such synaptic distributions to the properties of thalamocortical input onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons.  <a href=fncir-07-00177.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
