		We present an amazing observation that the log-mass density of the visible (shining) and the dark (non-shining) matter in spiral galaxies and at least in one galaxy cluster respects linear correlation, i.e. log rho_v = k log rho_d, with the same proportionality constant k=4. We interpret this fact in terms of thermodynamic Boltzman law, which leads to two conclusions: a) dark and visible components are in near-thermal equilibrium, which means that dark matter in fact is quite strongly interacting, and b) mass of dark matter particles is about 1/4 that of the proton mass, or 250MeV.   <a href=MolarMassExtimate2003.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
