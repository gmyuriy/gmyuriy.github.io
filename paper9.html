		In this paper we study duality in scalar field theory phi^6 from the position of canonical transformations. Duality in particles physics can be understood as existence of "effective" degrees of freedom (i.e. protons and neutrons) in a strongly interacting limit of theory with different "true" degrees of freedom (i.e. QCD and quarks, respectively). Duality can be therefore thought of as existence of a canonical transformation of the vacuum state of the theory that for strong interaction coupling constant changes the original theory formulated in terms of "quarks" into an effective theory in terms of "nucleons" interacting weakly. </body></html>
