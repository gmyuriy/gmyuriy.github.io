		In this paper I use complete reconstruction of a volume of neuropil from series of electron micrographs, at a few nm resolution, to show that light microscopy techniques such as isotropically diffraction limited light microscopy (ie array tomography or LM on ultra-thin slices) and linear structured illumination microscopy are sufficient to observe individual synapses in dense neuropil with accuracy over 99%. I use this fact to suggest an approach to mapping connectivity in a neural circuit by labeling synapses of different groups of cells using distinct color fluorescent synaptic markers, and then scanning neuropil optically searching for synaptic puncta of given color - thus identifying the location and number and size of all synapses between given populations of neurons.  <a href=Mishchenko_On_optical_Final_Full.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
