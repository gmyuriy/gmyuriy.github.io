		In this paper, an accessible myoelectric prosthetic hand design is described based on a modification of prior available mechanical prosthesis and all off-the-shelf parts and components. Despite significant advances in myoelectric prosthetics, existing such devices are firmly out of reach for a majority of the patients needing them, due to high cost and complexity of existing designs. This paper offers a simple design for a myoelectric prosthetic built on base of an existing mechanical prosthesis, which can be assembled with minimal expertise and all readily available parts, at approximately 1% the price of the cheapest commercially available such prosthetic.  <a href=TemJournalAugust2017_479_483.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
