		<h1>Yuriy Mishchenko Papers:<br>Mishchenko Y., Kaya M., Ozbay E., Yanar H. (2019) "Developing a 3- to 6-state EEG-based brain-computer interface for a virtual robotic manipulator control.",  IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 66 (4), 977-987</h1> 
		The paper describes development of an electroencephalography (EEG) based noninvasive BCI system that can be used for a robotic manipulator control and detecting user's mental intent based on motor-imagery BCI paradigm. Experiments involving 12 healthy participants and analyzed offline as well as online are described. The EEG BCI system is shown to correctly identify different motor imageries in EEG data with good accuracy. 3 participants are shown to achieve BCI control accuracy in offline experiments of 80-90%. 2 participants did not achieve satisfactory accuracy. Online BCI system is then implemented for control of a virtual 3 degree-of-freedom prosthetic arm and tested with 3 best participants. These participants were able to successfully complete online BCI control tasks demonstrating on average the error rate of 80% and requiring 5-10 seconds to complete manipulator move.   <a href=_ieee_v3.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
