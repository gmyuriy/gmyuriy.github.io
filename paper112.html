		Recent advances in technology bring about novel operating environments where the role of human participants is reduced to passive observation. While opening new frontiers in productivity and lifestyle, such environments also create hazards related to the inability of human individuals to maintain focus and concentration during passive control tasks. A passive brain-computer interface for monitoring mental attention states of human individuals (focused, unfocused, and drowsy) by using electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity imaging and machine learning data analysis methods is developed in this work. An EEG data processing pipeline and a machine learning mental state detection algorithm using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method were designed and compared with k-Nearest Neighbor and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy System methods. To collect 25 h of EEG data from 5 participants, a classic EEG headset was modified. We found that the changes in EEG activity in frontal and parietal lobes occurring at 1?5?Hz and 10?15?Hz frequency bands were associated with the changes in individuals? attention state. We demonstrated the ability to use such changes to identify individuals? attention state with 96.70% (best) and 91.72% (avg.) accuracy in experimental settings using a version of continuous performance task with SVM-based mental state detector. The findings help guide the design of future systems for monitoring the state of human individuals by means of EEG brain activity data. </body></html>
