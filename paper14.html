flavor oscillations with nonperturbative effects from quantum field theory.", Physics Letters B 594, 135</h1> 
		In this paper we study the applications of our formalism for QFT of flavor mixing, predicting in particular high-frequency oscillations component in flavor mixing primarily due to virtual anti-particles creation during oscillations, to phenomenologically interesting cases - neutrinos, kaons and eta.  <a href=PhenomenologyOfFlavorOscillations2004.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
