		<h1>Yuriy Mishchenko Papers:<br>Marblestone A., Daugharthy E., Kalhor R., Peikon I. D., et al. (2014) "Rosetta Brains: A Strategy for Molecularly-Annotated Connectomics.", arXiv:1404.5103</h1> 
		The paper discusses a novel connectomics approaches based on expressing two random genetic codes in pre- and post-synaptic neuronal cells, and reading out the combinations of the code pairs at actual synapses using a novel time-based fluorescent readout technique. </body></html>
