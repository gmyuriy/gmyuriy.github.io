"Wiring economy and volume exclusion determine neuronal placement in the Drosophila brain.", Current Biology, 21, 2000</h1> 
		This paper uses newly developed techniques for semi-automated reconstruction from serial electron microscopy (EM) to obtain the shapes of neurons, the location of synapses, and the resultant synaptic connectivity in a module of the Drosophila melanogaster brain known as lamina cartridge. Relying on these reconstructions, it proposes that wiring length minimization and volume exclusion together can explain the structure of the lamina microcircuit.   <a href=wiring_reprint.pdf>Full text</a></body></html>
